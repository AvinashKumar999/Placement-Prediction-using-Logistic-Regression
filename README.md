# Placement-Prediction-using-Logistic-Regression
Placements hold great importance for students and educational institutions. It helps a student to build a strong foundation for the professional career ahead as well as a good placement record gives a competitive edge to a college in the education market.              

This study focuses on a system that predicts if a student would be placed or not based on the studentâ€™s qualifications, historical data, and experience. This predictor uses a machine-learning algorithm to give the result. 

The algorithm used is logistic regression. Logistic regression is basically a supervised classification algorithm. In a classification problem, the target variable(or output), y, can take only discrete values for given set of features(or inputs), X. Talking about the dataset, it contains the secondary school percentage, higher secondary school percentage, degree percentage, degree, and work experience of students. After predicting the result its efficiency is also calculated based on the dataset.
